scheduler.js
============

A simple scheduler in Javascript

This was created to provide scheduling capability in Selenium IDE and web applications without having to resort to cron jobs or other ways which are not cross platform and easily accessible from a web application.

Supports a cron-like syntax and a module to accept english language support. Check my blog at blog.reallysimplethoughts.com for details.

New version with Angular.js support, more tests and documentation to follow. Someday.
